      "question": "How much does a charter flight cost?",
      "answer": "Charter costs vary based on aircraft type (Learjet 45XR or King Air B200), distance, duration, and specific mission requirements. We're committed to transparent, itemized billing with no hidden fees or broker markups. What you'll pay: aircraft hourly rate, crew & fuel (itemized), landing fees (actual costs), and catering (if requested). What you WON'T pay: broker markups, membership fees, upgrade penalties, or weather cancellation fees. Contact us at 432-561-9111 for a detailed quote in 60 seconds.

      "question": "Do you have hidden fees or broker markups?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. As a Part 135 operator (not a broker), we provide transparent, itemized billing with no hidden fees. You pay: aircraft hourly rate, crew & fuel, landing fees (actual costs), and catering (if requested). You do NOT pay: broker markups, membership fees, upgrade penalties, or weather cancellation fees. Private aviation has a \"glossy marketing problem\"—we prefer honest conversations and radical transparency.",

      "answer": "Yes! Our Learjet 45XR is perfect for luxury private travel across Texas. Popular routes include Austin to Horseshoe Bay (18 minutes vs. 2-hour drive), Dallas/Houston to Gulf Coast, and event travel (F1, SXSW, State Fair).

For NextGen travelers who value experiences over cost, charter eliminates TSA stress and maximizes destination enjoyment time.",

      "question": "Should I buy a fractional share or use charter?",
      "answer": "For executives flying <50 hours/year, on-demand charter delivers superior economics and flexibility. Charter advantages: zero capital investment (no $500K+ buy-in), mission-specific aircraft (Learjet for speed, King Air for access), no upgrade penalties, and cancel flexibility. Fractional requires substantial upfront capital, locks you to specific aircraft type, charges upgrade penalties, and includes cancellation fees. We also offer fixed rates for recurring routes to provide the cost certainty of jet cards without the commitment. Charter = pay per mission, maximum flexibility.",
